# Word Vectors


In natural language processing, we represent each word as a vector consisting of numbers.
The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine
learning models.
We use trained word vectors i.e. download pre-trained ones

## The code in the word_vectors files is used to
- Predicting  analogies between words.
- Comparing word embeddings by using a similarity measure (the cosine similarity).
