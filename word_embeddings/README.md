# Word Embeddings 

Exploring a classic way of generating word embeddings or representations.
- implementing   the continuous bag of words (CBOW) model. 

We:

- Train word vectors from scratch.
- create batches of data.
- Understand how backpropagation works.
- Plot and visualize  learned word vectors.
