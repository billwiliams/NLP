# Deep N-grams

Eexploring Recurrent Neural Networks `RNN` by implementing a system to predict next set of characters using previous characters.
- We will be using the fundamentals of google's [trax](https://github.com/google/trax) package to implement the  deeplearning model. 

outcomes:-
- How to convert a line of text into a tensor
- Creating an iterator to feed data to the model
- Defining a GRU model using `trax`
- Training the model using `trax`
- Computing the accuracy of your model using the perplexity
- Predict using the model
