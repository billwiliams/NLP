### Siamese Networks
cheking if two questions are the same using siamese networks

# Part 1: Importing the Data
<a name='1.1'></a>
### 1.1 Loading in the data

We will be using the Quora question answer dataset to build a model that could identify similar questions. This is a useful task because we don't want to have several versions of the same question posted.
we select only the question pairs that are duplicate to train the model. <br>
We build two batches as input for the Siamese network and we assume that question $q1_i$ (question $i$ in the first batch) is a duplicate of $q2_i$ (question $i$ in the second batch), but all other questions in the second batch are not duplicates of $q1_i$. 

TRAINING QUESTIONS:

Question 1:  Astrology: I am a Capricorn Sun Cap moon and cap rising...what does that say about me?
Question 2:  I'm a triple Capricorn (Sun, Moon and ascendant in Capricorn) What does this say about me? 

Question 1:  What would a Trump presidency mean for current international masterâ€™s students on an F1 visa?
Question 2:  How will a Trump presidency affect the students presently in US or planning to study in US? 

TESTING QUESTIONS:

Question 1:  How do I prepare for interviews for cse?
Question 2:  What is the best way to prepare for cse? 

is_duplicate = 0 

### Encoding questions

first question in the train set:

Astrology: I am a Capricorn Sun Cap moon and cap rising...what does that say about me?

first question in the test set:

How do I prepare for interviews for cse?

###  Defining the Siamese model

#### Understanding Siamese Network

A Siamese network is a neural network which uses the same weights while working in tandem on two different input vectors to compute comparable output vectors
A question embedding, is run  through an LSTM layer, normalized $v_1$ and $v_2$, and finally using a triplet loss we get the corresponding cosine similarity for each pair of questions.  The triplet loss makes use of a baseline (anchor) input that is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the positive (truthy) input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the negative (falsy) input is maximized.
