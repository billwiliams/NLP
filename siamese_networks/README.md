We will be using the Quora question answer dataset to build a model that could identify similar questions. This is a useful task because we don't want to have several versions of the same question posted.
we select only the question pairs that are duplicate to train the model. <br>
We build two batches as input for the Siamese network and we assume that question $q1_i$ (question $i$ in the first batch) is a duplicate of $q2_i$ (question $i$ in the second batch), but all other questions in the second batch are not duplicates of $q1_i$.
